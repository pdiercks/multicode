# Preprocessing

Besides repeatedly occuring grid tasks (e.g.`line.py` to generate meshes for the edges of a RCE),
a fine grid for a global structure can be created via `soi.py` and any ``.geo`` can be easily
converted to ``.xdmf`` for use with *FEniCS*.

## ToDo
1. Add docstring for `rce_type_02.py` and pull in additional dependency `edmd` or provide `rce_02.geo` only?
