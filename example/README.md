# Example

This example is used to demonstrate the use of the `multicode` library as well as to test it.
All tasks for this example are defined in `dodo.py` and can be run by:
```
python create_scenarios.py
doit
```

Note
----
The task definition depends on `scenarios.yml` which is created by executing `create_scenarios.py`.

## Workflow

First the user has to define the particular RCE (this includes a grid ``rce.xdmf`` generated by 
e.g. `preprocessing/rce_type_01.py` and corresponding metadata like e.g. unit length) and the
*scenario(s)* (see `create_scenarios.py`) for the problem to solve.
The library can then be used to handle the following tasks (see ``dodo.py`` for all tasks):
1. creation of grids for the boundary (*edges*) of the RCE (note that the user has to make
sure that these are conforming with the definition of the rce grid using e.g. ``gmsh``'s ``Transfinite Lines``),
2. creation of coarse and fine grid for 3x3 patch of RCEs needed in the *offline phase*.
3. construction of basis functions according to the scenario(s),
4. creation of fine grid of the structure of interest (if DNS is needed in the *online phase* for error computation).

What's left is the definition of the problem / structure of interest itself by:
* coarse grid,
* the program running the actual simulation.
